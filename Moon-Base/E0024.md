```python

# Write a script to generate a passphrase by taking words from
# /tmp/words.txt
# The wordNumbers array holds three random numbers. Each number
# corresponds to a word in words.txt. So for example
# wordNumbers[1] is the second word in /tmp/words.txt.
# Put a space between each word and print it out

with open("/tmp/randomwordsnumbers.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()

wordNumbers = data.rstrip().split("\n")
N = [int(i) for i in wordNumbers]

with open("/tmp/words.txt", "r") as words:
  wordlist = words.readlines()

passphrase = " ".join([wordlist[i].strip() for i in N])
print(passphrase)
