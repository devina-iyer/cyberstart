We're trying to make sense of a filesystem with a large number of empty directories that the aliens created. Can you write a script to browse the contents of /tmp/aliendir and see if you can actually find anything.

```python
import glob

dir_path = "/tmp/aliendir/*/*"

res = glob.glob(dir_path)
print(res)
```
